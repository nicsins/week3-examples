<!--This is actually not the recommended way, except for ~very~ simple pages.
 Why? It puts your javascript in two places, the HTML and script.
 it would be better to have all scripting in one place -->

<body>

  <h1 onclick="sayHello()">Click on this text to see an alert</h1>

  <script>

    function sayHello() {
      alert('hello');
    }

  </script>
