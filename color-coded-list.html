/*

This program is for creating a list of movies and TV shows.

When the button is clicked, read the name of the TV show or movie from the input.
And, find out if the is-movie input checkbox is checked.  
You'll need to use the checked property, not the value property. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_checkbox_checked.asp 

Create a new <li> element containing the name of the show/movie, the value of the text input
If the show is a TV show (the checkbox is unchecked), add the class tv-show
If the show is a movie, (the checkbox is checked) add the class movie
You can set the .className property of an element to set its class, https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_classname.asp

Add the new li element to the list.
Clear the input and un-check the checkbox.

Notice that there is some CSS provided which applies one color to elements with 
class movie, and a different color to tv-show. You may change the styles if you prefer.

Finally, include some validation. Ignore any empty inputs.
(Tricky part) And, show an alert message if the show/movie is already in the list. 
Don't add the show/movie again.
